For the assignment, 3 steps:

1. Data Exploration Analysis (including Data Cleaning and Data Visualization and Basic Analysis)
2. Simple direct method: after exploration, it's possible to manually set the threshold to do prediction
3. Simple Model Building (including Feature Engineering), since it's fraud detection, the models can include:
   Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and SVM.
